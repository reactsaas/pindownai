## Pinboard Structure

A pinboard contains:

- **Basic Info**: `id`, `name`, `description`
- **Content**: Array of pin IDs in `pins`
- **Metadata**: `created_at`, `author`, `views`
- **Permissions**: `is_public` flag

## Pin Management

Pinboards automatically manage the relationship between pins and collections:

- Adding a pin to a pinboard doesn't duplicate the pin
- Removing a pin from a pinboard doesn't delete the pin
- Pins can belong to multiple pinboards
- Deleting a pinboard doesn't delete the pins

## Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND` | Pinboard not found |
| `PERMISSION_DENIED` | Insufficient permissions |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Invalid request data |
| `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` | Server error |
